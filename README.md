# CHALLENGE FRONTEND DIVISION AMCC

This Web App is determine to Challange in Frontend Division at AMCC. I learn a lot from this simple UI building, because now I really know how to implement and have a wider paradigm about Web App. Not only that, I really enjoy to make this Web App even I faces a lot of problems. A simple as I appreciate a small things that I've done, finally I can get through all of this things.

A ticklish story, I think with the time that I have, I can finish it. But, I regret about what I'm saying after I faces a lot of problems on my process to get done this Web App. So cuz of that, I have learned about a something that I called **Procrastination**. Procrastination not only kill the time, but kill the goal also. I didn't realize after I faces that result. I also not aware about anything in surrounding me, cuz I think I've done this Web App but actually I'm not really close in that finish line. But yeah, time can't be repeated and I just only get the choose to learn from what I experienced before. Thanks for AMCC that give me a chance to improve my skills.
